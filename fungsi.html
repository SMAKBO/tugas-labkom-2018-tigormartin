<p style="text-align: center" >In general, the applications of stearic acid exploit its bifunctional character, with a polar head group that can be attached to metal cations and a nonpolar chain that confers solubility in organic solvents. The combination leads to uses as a surfactant and softening agent. Stearic acid undergoes the typical reactions of saturated carboxylic acids, a notable one being reduction to stearyl alcohol, and esterification with a range of alcohols. This is used in a large range of manufactures, from simple to complex electronic devices.</p>

<h2> Candlemaking </h2>

<p > In our domain, candlemaking, Stearic acid is available in powder or granulated form, has a pure white color and feels a little fat when you touch it. Its melting point is 158 &#8728F.
It is mainly used:
<br>
&#9762to raise the melting point of the paraffin it gets mixed with (logically, one part paraffin with a melting point of 130&#8728F mixed with one equal part paraffin with a melting point of 150&#8728F results in a mixture whose melting point averages 140&#8728F). Adding a substance with a high melting point like stearin to paraffin has a tendency to raise the average melting point of the mixture,on the contrary, to lower the melting point of a high melting point paraffin,
<br>
&#9762to give the colors a pastel shade,
<br>
&#9762to "harden" the candle. Stearin can act as a hardener
<br>
&#9762to make the candle burn longer (due to the fact that the melting point is higher). 
<br><br>

<strong style="font-size:30px ">CAUTION!</strong>
Stearin should not be used in combination with rubber or latex molds because it might "eat them up" (it is an acid, after all). If you're planning on using rubber molds, replace stearin with Vybar.

<br><br>
The proportion of stearin you will use depends on the effect you're looking for. As a hardener, the common proportion is 3 teaspoons per pound (453 grams) of paraffin.Used in higher proportions, stearin will opacify the wax, thus the finished candle too.

<h2>Lubricants, softening and release agents</h2>

In view of the soft texture of the sodium salt, which is the main component of soap, other salts are also useful for their lubricating properties. Lithium stearate is an important component of grease. The stearate salts of zinc, calcium, cadmium, and lead are used to soften PVC. Stearic acid is used along with castor oil for preparing softeners in textile sizing. They are heated and mixed with caustic potash or caustic soda. Related salts are also commonly used as release agents, e.g. in the production of automobile tires.</p>
